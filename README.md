### A repository of solving tools for the NPR Sunday puzzle

Every week, I attempt to solve the NPR Sunday puzzle with Python.  Generally speaking, I only allow myself to use
- Only core Python libraries and NLTK
- The [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)
- FamousNames.txt (also culled from Wikipedia)

It's impressive what you can do with these tools -- get rhyming words, lists of category members, all sorts of wordplay operations.  Hopefully you'll like looking through the examples as much as I liked making them.  Enjoy!
