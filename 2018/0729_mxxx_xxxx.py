Think of a familiar two-word phrase in 8 letters â€” with 4 letters in each word. 
The first word starts with M. Move the first letter of the second word to the 
end and you'll get a regular 8-letter word, which, amazingly, other than the M, 
doesn't share any sounds with the original two-word phrase. What phrase is it?
